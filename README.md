This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data retrieval methods. The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect approach of accessing document snapshot data before it's ready, leading to undefined values or errors. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes Promises or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations correctly, ensuring data integrity and preventing errors.
